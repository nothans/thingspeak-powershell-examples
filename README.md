# ThingSpeak-PowerShell
Send data to ThingSpeak from a Windows PowerShell Script

## Getting Started with ThingSpeak
[ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com) is an open source **Internet of Things** application and API to store and retrieve data from anything using HTTP over the Internet or via a Local Area Network.

### Sign Up for ThingSpeak
* Sign Up for New User Account - [https://thingspeak.com/login](https://thingspeak.com/login)
* Create a new Channel by selecting _Channels_, _My Channels_, and then _New Channel_
* Copy and save the ThingSpeak Write API Key and enter it into the PowerShell Script

## freespace.ps1
When this script executes, _[freespace.ps1](/freespace.ps1)_ will report the free space of the disk drive to a ThingSpeak Channel.

### Script Notes:

* Place the _freespace.ps1_ Windows PowerShell script on your desktop computer / server
* Make sure you set the correct drive letter, such as "C:" or "D:"
* Make sure to enter your ThingSpeak Wite API Key for your Channel
